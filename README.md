# Contextual-AI-Assistant
it is a contextual Ai assistant (more than a chatbot) which is build using Rasa Frame work. It's development involves 2 major parts: NLU and Actions

# NLU
Rasa NLU is trained with a set of intents with as many examples as you can add, and with understanding the language it predict next best reply.
Custom Actions are build with python and Rasa predefined functions. My custom action will produce the address of hospital in your city either with the help of area PIN-code or with the help of city name
